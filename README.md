# spaghetti
Draw cool randomly generated drawings, sometimes resembling spaghetti.

Right now, the prototype only draws in four directions, get's stuck a lot, and doesn't know how to fill in the whole page. The goal is to make it fully automatic, and smart enough to simulate the behavior of a real person.
